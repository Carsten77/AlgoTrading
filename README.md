# AlgoTrading

This repo is based on the final project of the course "Algorithmic Trading" taught at Hult International Business School by professor Michael Rolleigh. The goal is to backtest a trading algorithm that recieves the output from a machine learning model as a signal to perform the strategy.   

The corresponding tasks are divided in the following notebooks. 


```python
AlgoTrading.py 
``` 


```python 
Backtesting.py
```
